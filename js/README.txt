These scripts are provided as-is, with no guarantee or warantee to their effectiveness or implications to your 
dashboards, widgets, or data. Some may flat out don't work (specifically the two that try to edit tables). If 
you have any thoughts on how to improve these, please let me know. However, note that this is not an exercise in 
trying to optimize or write perfect code. Think of these as second-hand Ikea furniture. The guy who put it
together obviously wasn't trying too hard. It might be a bit wobbly, but take it home, slap a coat of paint 
on it, trim the edges to make it fit your space, and it'll do the job.

Good luck. Any questions, contact Nick at: nburleigh@gmail.com

Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose.
